[1]  The Story

	A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, a planet was in big trouble. 
Poisonous gas choked the atmosphere, and slowly the planet would wither and 
die.  Dirt and scum abounded, covering everything.  But the citizens were 
helpless, because they couldn't wash it off!  They were out of soap!
	The planet was dying, the soap warehouses were empty, and help was 
far away.  So Lord Haples of the planet Soprina called to his retainers to ready his 
ship for travel (would you want to stick around?) to get him a new gas mask filter.
So he flew off from a planet plagued with bad body odor and smelly feet.  He alone 
was the only hope to end his planet's suffering.


[2]  Controls

The controls in Space Rocks are very simple.  It's all in the wrist.

Mouse:
Left click  - fire
Right click - activate shields

<ESCAPE> Exits the game while in the action screen


[3] Troubleshooting

Q: "The animation is slow and choppy."
A: You need to free more system resources. Shut down some other applications and 
   run it again or run it from the DOS prompt.

Q: "That sound is annoying!"
A: Start Space Rocks with the 's' parameter (spacerck s). This will turn off the 
   sound.

Q: "It replies 'Not enough memory'!"
A: This happens after you repeatedly start a new game. Exit and restart the entire 
   game and it should work fine.

Q: "It replies 'Failed to open the RLEDAT file'!"
A: You are missing the data file. Try downloading the latest version at

[4] Bugs

We understand that bugs can be a problem, and in that we will strive to correct as
many as possible and post the latest version and bug fix on our website. If you do
find a bug, we would appreciate it if you would e-mail us at cnhscgct@hotmail.com
with a description of your problem. Thanks!

v1.0  (11/08/99)  - Initial Release			
v1.01 (11/11/99)  - when restart game, the score on-screen is immediately reset to 0
		  - when restart game, the 'Level x' display was fixed


[5] The Sound

You may have realized that several of our students were credited with having worked
on the sound, yet the game contains almost none. Due to technical difficulties, our
more advanced (and better sounding) sound system could not be included in this 
version of the game. To keep within the deadline, we were forced to include minimal
PC speaker sounds. We may later release a patch to add digitized sound to Space Rocks. 
Sorry!
